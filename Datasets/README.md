## MMS Dataset
The MMS dataset consists of raw network traffic capture files (*.pcapng) only. The dataset involves benign control behaviours based on the following seven commands:

- Action 1. Show a list of MMS domains on different IEDs
- Action 2. Show the server identity of different IEDs
- Action 3. Show the domain directory in different IEDs
- Action 4. Control IEDs in different modes, including direct control, status check, and direct control with enhanced security
- Action 5. Read invalid or non-existent journals from the domain directory in different IEDs
- Action 6. Request invalid or non-existent files from different IEDs
